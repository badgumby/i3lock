i3lock - Modified by BadGumby
===============================
I have made changes that I personally wanted.

*Original information below *

i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will
see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return
to your screen by entering your password.

Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:

- i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM
  (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
   after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

- You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
  displayed while your screen is locked.

- You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

- i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
